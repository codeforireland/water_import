Irish Water Website: 

1. General Info: https://www.water.ie/water-supply/water-quality/

2. Getting zone information for area (town) -> URL has lat long params - does this work for coordinates too? 
	url: https://www.water.ie/water-supply/water-quality/results/?act=findAddress&lat=&long=&wq-address=Phibsborough 
       METHOD: GET
       -> Response: 
			HTML page with zone information and a water quality overview
       
	You are able to use this to get the summary of your area. You can get the Zone ID by parsing the resulting HTML page for the tag "<div class="col-xs-10 col-xs-offset-2 col-lg-6 col-lg-offset-0" id="zoneNamePdf">DCC Zone 1</div>". 
    
3. Getting specific test results - the following code returns data for Dublin Zone 1 - how do we get other zones 
	maybe the filter param specifies the zone (if yes, how do we get this information?)
	url: https://www.water.ie/water-supply/water-quality/results/summary/allresults.xml?filter=1&wq-date-from=01-Jan-2017&wq-date-to=31-Dec-2017&wq-parameter=
          METHOD: GET

	The result returns a HTML page including the following table with ID: <table class="water-quality-table with-top-border" id="wq-table">
	This table holds the individual test results for this area in clear data, means we can parse it row by row

4. Goal: CSV file with water quality data
